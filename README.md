# HAFIF: Human-AI Field Intelligence Fusion

## Summary

HAFIF is an original methodology developed by Artem Leonov in 2024â€“2025. It proposes a hybrid system for threat simulation, combining human logic with AI-driven hypothesis synthesis to emulate threat development scenarios. The framework is designed to replace traditional OSINT workflows with dynamic, simulation-based situational modeling.

## Purpose

To provide an analytical environment capable of:

- Simulating complex threat scenarios from minimal inputs
- Generating alternative hypotheses and eliminating dead-ends through logical pruning
- Constructing forward-looking intelligence models with adversarial behavior emulation

## Use Cases

- Spoofed SIGINT attack reconstruction
- Infrastructure compromise mapping (SCADA, subsea cables)
- Proxy-state hybrid actor simulations
- Telegram + financial metadata manipulation scenarios
